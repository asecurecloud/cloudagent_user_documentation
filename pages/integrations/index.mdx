# IDE Integrations

Connect CloudAgent to your favorite IDE and deploy AWS infrastructure using natural language.

## Supported IDEs

CloudAgent integrates with any MCP-compatible tool. Here are our officially supported integrations:

| IDE | MCP Support | Setup Time | Best For |
|-----|-------------|------------|----------|
| [Cursor](/integrations/cursor) | Native | 2 min | AI-first developers |
| [VS Code](/integrations/vscode) | Extension | 5 min | Largest ecosystem |
| [Claude Desktop](/integrations/claude-desktop) | Native | 2 min | Claude power users |
| [ChatGPT](/integrations/chatgpt) | Plugin | 3 min | ChatGPT subscribers |
| [JetBrains](/integrations/jetbrains) | Built-in (2025.2+) | 3 min | Enterprise Java/Python |

## How It Works

1. **Get your MCP config** from [Dashboard → MCP Extension](/dashboard/mcp)
2. **Add to your IDE** following the guide for your tool
3. **Authenticate** via OAuth when prompted
4. **Start deploying** using natural language

```
You: "Create an S3 bucket for user uploads with encryption"
CloudAgent: Creates S3 bucket with AES-256 encryption, versioning,
            and block public access — all security baselines applied.
```

## Why IDE Integration?

- **Stay in flow** — no context switching to AWS console
- **Natural language** — describe what you need, not how to configure it
- **Automatic security** — baselines applied to every resource
- **Governance built-in** — tags, naming, and compliance enforced

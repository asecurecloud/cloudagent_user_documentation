# 🛠️ Blueprint Builder

## Objective
Design, visualize, and deploy standardized infrastructure templates across your environments.

The **Blueprint Builder** allows you to design and deploy infrastructure templates.

## AI-Assisted Builder

The Blueprint Builder uses an AI agent to help you design infrastructure templates. Instead of writing complex code from scratch, you describe what you want in plain English.

### How it Works

1.  **Define Objective**: Start by describing your goal (e.g., "Create a highly available ECS cluster with an Application Load Balancer").
2.  **Generate Skeleton**: The AI analyzes your request and proposes a "Skeleton Plan" broken down into phases:
    *   **Assessment**: Checks prerequisites and current state.
    *   **Configuration**: Defines the resources and settings.
    *   **Validation**: Ensures the design meets best practices.
3.  **Refine & Customize**: Use the **Plan Builder Assistant** chat to refine tasks, add notes, or change deployment methods (CloudFormation or CLI).
4.  **Finalize**: Once satisfied, the builder generates the executable blueprint.

### Key Capabilities

-   **Chat Interface**: Interact with the AI to iterate on your design.
-   **Phased Approach**: Structured plans ensure no steps are missed.
-   **Permission Calculation**: Automatically identifies the IAM permissions required to deploy the blueprint.
-   **Deployment Options**: Support for standard CloudFormation stacks or CLI-based deployments.

To access it:
1.  Click on **My Blueprints** in the left sidebar.
3.  Click **Create Blueprint** to start a new design.

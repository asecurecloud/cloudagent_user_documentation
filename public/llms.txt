## Key Sections

*   **Overview**: A summary of your cloud resources and agent activity.
*   **Cloud Setup & Workloads**: Manage your cloud infrastructure connections.
*   **Recommendations**: AI-driven suggestions for optimizing your cloud environment.
*   **My Workflows**: View and manage your automated workflows.
*   **My Blueprints**: Create and manage infrastructure blueprints.
*   **Activity**: A log of recent actions and events.
*   **My Account**: Manage your profile and settings. 

# Blueprint Builder 

# 🛠️ Blueprint Builder

## Objective
Design, visualize, and deploy standardized infrastructure templates across your environments.

The **Blueprint Builder** allows you to design and deploy infrastructure templates.

## AI-Assisted Builder

The Blueprint Builder uses an AI agent to help you design infrastructure templates. Instead of writing complex code from scratch, you describe what you want in plain English.

### How it Works

1.  **Define Objective**: Start by describing your goal (e.g., "Create a highly available ECS cluster with an Application Load Balancer").
2.  **Generate Skeleton**: The AI analyzes your request and proposes a "Skeleton Plan" broken down into phases:
    *   **Assessment**: Checks prerequisites and current state.
    *   **Configuration**: Defines the resources and settings.
    *   **Validation**: Ensures the design meets best practices.
3.  **Refine & Customize**: Use the **Plan Builder Assistant** chat to refine tasks, add notes, or change deployment methods (CloudFormation or CLI).
4.  **Finalize**: Once satisfied, the builder generates the executable blueprint.

### Key Capabilities

-   **Chat Interface**: Interact with the AI to iterate on your design.
-   **Phased Approach**: Structured plans ensure no steps are missed.
-   **Permission Calculation**: Automatically identifies the IAM permissions required to deploy the blueprint.
-   **Deployment Options**: Support for standard CloudFormation stacks or CLI-based deployments.

To access it:
1.  Click on **My Blueprints** in the left sidebar.
3.  Click **Create Blueprint** to start a new design.

# AI Assistant 

# 🤖 CloudAgent Assistant

The **CloudAgent Assistant** is an AI-powered companion designed to help you manage your cloud infrastructure using natural language. It lives in the bottom-right corner of the application and is always ready to assist.

## Overview

The Assistant is capable of performing complex operations by connecting directly to your cloud environment and the CloudAgent backend. It translates your English requests into specific actions, such as running AWS CLI commands, deploying CloudFormation stacks, or managing your workloads.

> **Note:** 
  **Tip**: You can ask the Assistant to "explain" resources or errors to get context-aware answers.

## Capabilities

The Assistant is equipped with a powerful set of tools that allow it to:

### 1. 🔍 AWS Discovery & Inspection
You can ask the Assistant to inspect your live AWS environment. It uses read-only AWS CLI commands to fetch real-time data.

*   **"List all EC2 instances in us-east-1."**
*   **"Describe the security group 'sg-12345'."**
*   **"Check if I have any S3 buckets with public access."**

### 2. 📦 Workload Management
The Assistant can view and update your CloudAgent workloads directly.

*   **"List my workloads."**
*   **"Update the 'payments' workload to use the 'prod' environment."**
*   **"Add a rule to the 'portal' workload to prevent public S3 buckets."**

### 3. 🏗️ Infrastructure Deployment
You can deploy or update infrastructure using CloudFormation. The Assistant will always ask for your approval before making changes.

*   **"Deploy a new S3 bucket named 'my-app-logs'."**
*   **"Update the 'payments-stack' to enable versioning."**
*   **"Create a standard VPC with 2 AZs."** (Uses built-in architecture templates)

### 4. 🧠 Research & Validation
The Assistant has access to the web to research best practices, validate syntax, and find solutions to errors.

*   **"How do I configure an ALB for gRPC?"**
*   **"Find the CloudFormation syntax for an ECS Fargate service."**
*   **"What does this error message mean?"**

## How to Use

1.  Click the **CloudAgent** button in the bottom-right corner.
2.  Type your request in plain English.
3.  The Assistant will analyze your request and may:
    *   Ask clarifying questions.
    *   Run a read-only command to gather context.
    *   Propose a plan of action (e.g., a CloudFormation template).
4.  **Review and Approve**: For any action that modifies your infrastructure, the Assistant will present a plan. You must approve it before execution proceeds.

## Safety & Security

*   **Read-Only by Default**: The Assistant defaults to read-only actions for discovery.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop**: All state-changing operations (Create, Update, Delete) require explicit user confirmation.
*   **Guardrails**: Deployments are checked against your organization's security rules and policies.

# Cookbooks 


# Overview 

# 🍳 Cookbooks

Welcome to the CloudAgent Cookbooks! Here you will find step-by-step guides and recipes for common tasks and advanced configurations.

## Available Cookbooks

*   [**Automating Remediation**](/cookbooks/remediation)
    *   Learn how to identify security issues, remediate them with blueprints, and verify the fix in a full-circle workflow. 

# Automating Remediation 

# Automating Security Remediation from Discovery to Fix

This cookbook guides you through a complete workflow: identifying a security issue, fixing it with a blueprint, and verifying the resolution.

## Objective
To secure a public S3 bucket using CloudAgent's recommendation engine and blueprint builder.

## Step 1: Assessment

Start by reviewing the **Dashboard** to identify critical security findings.

1.  Navigate to the **Dashboard**.
2.  Look at the **Smart Recommendations** widget.
3.  Click on **🔒 Critical Security**.
4.  Locate the recommendation: **"S3 Bucket has public access enabled"**.

> **Tip**: Click on the number of items (e.g., "3 Items") to see the specific resources affected by this recommendation.

![Finding Recommendation Details](/images/recommendation_click_guide.png)

> **Note:** 
  Public S3 buckets can expose sensitive data. It is critical to remediate this immediately unless public access is intentionally required.

## Step 2: Remediation

CloudAgent allows you to generate a remediation blueprint directly from the recommendation.

1.  Click the **Remediate** button next to the finding.
2.  This opens the **Blueprint Builder** with a pre-configured template.
3.  Review the generated CloudFormation template. It should include `PublicAccessBlockConfiguration` set to `true`.
4.  Click **Deploy** to apply the fix.

### Example Snippet
The blueprint will automatically add this configuration to your bucket:

```yaml
Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
Properties:
  BucketName: my-sensitive-data-bucket
  PublicAccessBlockConfiguration:
    BlockPublicAcls: true
    BlockPublicPolicy: true
    IgnorePublicAcls: true
    RestrictPublicBuckets: true
```

## Step 3: Validation

Once the deployment is complete, verify that the issue is resolved.

1.  Go back to the **Dashboard**.
2.  Check the **Activity** feed for the "Remediation Deployment" success status.
3.  Refresh the **Smart Recommendations** list.
4.  Verify that the "S3 Bucket has public access enabled" finding is **Gone**.

> **Note:** 
  **Success!** You have successfully identified, remediated, and verified a security vulnerability using CloudAgent.

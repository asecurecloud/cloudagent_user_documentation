# AI Assistant

# CloudAgent Assistant

The **CloudAgent Assistant** is an AI-powered companion designed to help you manage your cloud infrastructure using natural language. It lives in the bottom-right corner of the application and is always ready to assist.

## Overview

The Assistant is capable of performing complex operations by connecting directly to your cloud environment and the CloudAgent backend. It translates your English requests into specific actions, such as running AWS CLI commands, deploying CloudFormation stacks, or managing your workloads.

> **Note:** 
  **Tip**: You can ask the Assistant to "explain" resources or errors to get context-aware answers.

## Capabilities

The Assistant is equipped with a powerful set of tools that allow it to:

### 1. AWS Discovery and Inspection
You can ask the Assistant to inspect your live AWS environment. It uses read-only AWS CLI commands to fetch real-time data.

*   **"List all EC2 instances in us-east-1."**
*   **"Describe the security group 'sg-12345'."**
*   **"Check if I have any S3 buckets with public access."**

### 2. Workload Management
The Assistant can view and update your CloudAgent workloads directly.

*   **"List my workloads."**
*   **"Update the 'payments' workload to use the 'prod' environment."**
*   **"Add a rule to the 'portal' workload to prevent public S3 buckets."**

### 3. Infrastructure Deployment
You can deploy or update infrastructure using CloudFormation. The Assistant will always ask for your approval before making changes.

*   **"Deploy a new S3 bucket named 'my-app-logs'."**
*   **"Update the 'payments-stack' to enable versioning."**
*   **"Create a standard VPC with 2 AZs."** (Uses built-in architecture templates)

### 4. Research and Validation
The Assistant has access to the web to research best practices, validate syntax, and find solutions to errors.

*   **"How do I configure an ALB for gRPC?"**
*   **"Find the CloudFormation syntax for an ECS Fargate service."**
*   **"What does this error message mean?"**

## How to Use

1.  Click the **CloudAgent** button in the bottom-right corner.
2.  Type your request in plain English.
3.  The Assistant will analyze your request and may:
    *   Ask clarifying questions.
    *   Run a read-only command to gather context.
    *   Propose a plan of action (e.g., a CloudFormation template).
4.  **Review and Approve**: For any action that modifies your infrastructure, the Assistant will present a plan. You must approve it before execution proceeds.

## Safety and Security

*   **Read-Only by Default**: The Assistant defaults to read-only actions for discovery.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop**: All state-changing operations (Create, Update, Delete) require explicit user confirmation.
*   **Guardrails**: Deployments are checked against your organization's security rules and policies.

# MCP Integration

# MCP Integration

## Objective
Connect your IDE to CloudAgent using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to build and deploy cloud infrastructure directly from your development environment.

> **Note:** 
  **What is MCP?** The Model Context Protocol is an open standard that allows AI-powered IDEs like Cursor to connect to external tools and services. CloudAgent's MCP server lets your AI coding assistant deploy infrastructure on your behalf, with built-in guardrails.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up MCP, ensure you have:

- A CloudAgent account with at least one [connected AWS environment](/guide/onboarding)
- [Cursor IDE](https://cursor.com) installed (version 0.43 or later)
- A workload configured with your team's security baselines and governance rules

## Step 1: Get Your MCP Configuration

1. Log in to [CloudAgent](https://cloudagent.io).
2. Navigate to **My Account** → **MCP Extension**.
3. Copy the configuration using **Copy Configuration** or download it with **Download Config**.

The configuration file looks like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cloudagent": {
      "url": "https://api.cloudagent.io/mcp",
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Configure Cursor

1. Open Cursor IDE.
2. Open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS, `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux).
3. Search for **"Cursor Settings: Open MCP Config"** and select it.
4. Paste your CloudAgent MCP configuration.
5. Save the file and restart Cursor.

> **Note:** 
  **Other Tools**: CloudAgent MCP also works with ChatGPT, Claude, and other MCP-compatible tools. Check the Setup Instructions tabs on the MCP Extension page for tool-specific guidance.

## Step 3: Authenticate with OAuth

When you first connect to the CloudAgent MCP server, you'll be prompted to authenticate:

1. Open a new chat in Cursor (Composer or Chat panel).
2. Type any CloudAgent command, such as: **"List my CloudAgent workloads"**
3. Cursor will prompt you to authenticate with CloudAgent via OAuth.
4. Complete the OAuth flow in your browser.
5. Once authenticated, the AI will respond with your available workloads.

You should see output similar to:

```
Connected to CloudAgent. Available workloads:
- payments-api (prod)
- user-portal (staging)
- data-pipeline (dev)
```

> **Note:** 
  **Authentication**: MCP authentication uses OAuth. You'll be prompted to authenticate when first connecting to the MCP server. Your session will persist until you sign out.

## Available MCP Capabilities

Once connected, your IDE can perform the following operations through CloudAgent:

### Read Operations (No Approval Required)
- List workloads and their configurations
- View security baselines and governance rules
- Check deployment status and history
- Query AWS resources within workload scope

### Write Operations (Requires Approval)
- Deploy infrastructure blueprints
- Update workload configurations
- Create or modify AWS resources

> **Note:** 
  **Guardrails Active**: All deployments are validated against your workload's security baselines before execution. If a request violates a security rule, it will be blocked with an explanation.

## Troubleshooting

### "Connection refused" or "Server not found"
- Verify the MCP server URL is `https://api.cloudagent.io/mcp`
- Check that `enabled` is set to `true` in your configuration
- Verify your network allows outbound HTTPS connections

### OAuth authentication not working
- Ensure pop-ups are allowed for the OAuth flow
- Try signing out and re-authenticating
- Clear your browser cookies for cloudagent.io and try again

### "Permission denied" on deployment
- Your workload may have restrictive security baselines
- Contact your security team to review the blocked rule
- Check the CloudAgent dashboard for detailed error logs

### MCP server not appearing in Cursor
- Restart Cursor after saving the MCP configuration
- Ensure the JSON syntax is valid (no trailing commas)
- Check Cursor's developer console for error messages

Protect sensitive data by preventing accidental public exposure of S3 buckets. 

In this guide, we will use CloudAgent's recommendation engine to identify the risk and the blueprint builder to remediate it automatically.

## Step 1: Assessment

Start by reviewing the **Recommendations** page to identify security findings.

1.  Navigate to **Recommendations** in the sidebar.
2.  Review the recommendation categories at the top (Critical Security, Cost Savings, Resource Cleanup, etc.).
3.  Look for recommendations in the **Critical Security** category.
4.  Locate the recommendation: **"Enable S3 Block Public Access at Account Level"**.

> **Tip**: Click on a category card to filter the list by that category.

![Recommendations Page](/images/recommendation_click_guide.png)

> **Note:** 
  Public S3 buckets can expose sensitive data. Remediate this promptly unless public access is intentionally required.

## Step 2: Remediation

CloudAgent allows you to generate a remediation blueprint directly from the recommendation.

1.  Find the recommendation in the list.
2.  Click **Run Blueprint** or **Generate Blueprint** in the Automatic Remediation column.
3.  This opens the **Blueprint Builder** with a pre-configured template.
4.  Review the generated CloudFormation template.
5.  Click **Execute** to apply the fix.

### Example Snippet
The blueprint will configure S3 Block Public Access at the account level:

```yaml
Type: AWS::S3::AccountPublicAccessBlock
Properties:
  AccountId: !Ref AWS::AccountId
  PublicAccessBlockConfiguration:
    BlockPublicAcls: true
    BlockPublicPolicy: true
    IgnorePublicAcls: true
    RestrictPublicBuckets: true
```

## Step 3: Validation

Once the deployment is complete, verify that the issue is resolved.

1.  Go back to the **Recommendations** page.
2.  Check that the recommendation status has changed or the item is no longer listed.
3.  Optionally, run a compliance report to confirm the fix.

# Cursor + MCP Integration

# Developing in the Corporate Cloud with Guardrails

## Objective
Enable developers to ship faster while maintaining security and compliance standards.

This guide shows how to connect Cursor IDE to CloudAgent via MCP, allowing developers to provision AWS infrastructure using natural language while security and platform teams enforce governance automatically.

## The Challenge

Modern development teams want speed. They want to provision infrastructure as fast as they can write code. But in enterprise environments, this creates tension:

- **Developers** want self-service access to spin up resources quickly
- **Security teams** need to enforce baselines (encryption, no public access, approved instance types)
- **Platform teams** must ensure tagging, cost controls, and architectural standards

The traditional approach (tickets, approval queues, and handoffs) slows everyone down.

## The Solution: IDE + CloudAgent MCP

By connecting Cursor to CloudAgent via MCP (Model Context Protocol), you create a **governed self-service** model:

```

│                            │                                    │
│                            ▼                                    │
│              Validated and Deployed to AWS                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Result**: Developers move fast. Security and platform teams sleep well.

## Who Does What?

### Developer Workflow

Developers interact with cloud infrastructure using natural language in their IDE:

```
Developer: "Create a DynamoDB table for session storage"
```

CloudAgent's MCP server:
1. Parses the request
2. Identifies the workload context
3. Generates a compliant blueprint
4. Applies security baselines and governance rules automatically
5. Returns a preview for approval
6. Deploys to AWS

The developer never needs to know the specific tagging requirements, encryption settings, or VPC configurations; CloudAgent handles it.

### Security Team Workflow

Security teams define **workload security baselines** in CloudAgent:

| Baseline Rule | Effect |
|--------------|--------|
| `require-encryption-at-rest` | All S3, EBS, RDS resources must have encryption enabled |
| `block-public-access` | Prevents creation of public S3 buckets or security groups with 0.0.0.0/0 |
| `approved-instance-types` | Limits EC2 to approved instance families (e.g., t3, m5) |
| `require-vpc` | All resources must be deployed within the designated VPC |

When a developer request violates a baseline, CloudAgent blocks it and explains why:

```
Request blocked: Security baseline violation

Rule: block-public-access
Reason: S3 bucket 'user-uploads' cannot have public read access.
Suggestion: Remove PublicReadAccess or request an exception from your security team.
```

### Platform Team Workflow

Platform teams configure **governance rules** on workloads:

| Governance Rule | Example |
|----------------|---------|
| Required tags | `Environment`, `CostCenter`, `Owner` |
| Naming conventions | `{env}-{app}-{resource}` pattern |
| Region restrictions | Deploy only to `us-east-1` and `us-west-2` |
| Cost controls | Maximum instance size, budget alerts |

These rules are automatically applied to every deployment. If a developer forgets to specify tags, CloudAgent adds them based on the workload context.

## Step-by-Step Setup

### For Security Teams: Define Baselines

1. Navigate to **Cloud Setup & Workloads** → select your workload.
2. Go to the **Security Rules** tab.
3. Enable the baseline rules that match your organization's requirements:
   - Require encryption at rest
   - Block public access
   - Enforce TLS 1.2+
   - Require VPC deployment
4. Click **Save**.

> **Note:** 
  **Tip**: Start with a restrictive baseline and add exceptions as needed. It's easier to relax rules than to tighten them after resources are deployed.

### For Platform Teams: Configure Governance

1. Navigate to **Cloud Setup & Workloads** → select your workload.
2. Go to the **Governance** tab.
3. Configure required tags:

```yaml
required_tags:
  - key: Environment
    allowed_values: [dev, staging, prod]
  - key: CostCenter
    required: true
  - key: Owner
    default_from: workload.owner
```

4. Set naming conventions:

```yaml
naming_pattern: "{environment}-{workload_name}-{resource_type}"
# Example output: prod-payments-api-bucket
```

5. Click **Save**.

### For Developers: Connect Your IDE

1. Get your MCP configuration from CloudAgent (**My Account** → **MCP Extension**).
2. Open Cursor IDE → **Settings** → **MCP Config**.
3. Paste the configuration and restart Cursor.
4. Authenticate via OAuth when prompted on first use.
5. Start building!

> See the full setup guide: **[MCP Integration](/guide/mcp)**

## Example: Building a Feature End-to-End

Let's walk through a real scenario: A developer needs to add file upload functionality to an application.

### Developer Request (in Cursor)

```
Create the infrastructure for user file uploads:
- S3 bucket for storing files
- Lambda function to process uploads
- API Gateway endpoint for the upload API
```

### CloudAgent Processing

1. **Context Injection**: CloudAgent identifies this is for the `user-portal` workload in `staging`
2. **Blueprint Generation**: Creates CloudFormation/Terraform with:
   - S3 bucket with encryption, versioning, and private access
   - Lambda with VPC configuration and IAM role
   - API Gateway with throttling
3. **Governance Applied**: Adds required tags and naming conventions
4. **Security Validation**: Checks all resources against baselines

### Preview Returned to Developer

```yaml
# CloudAgent will deploy the following resources:

Resources:
  staging-user-portal-uploads-bucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketEncryption:
        ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration:
          - ServerSideEncryptionByDefault:
              SSEAlgorithm: AES256
      PublicAccessBlockConfiguration:
        BlockPublicAcls: true
        BlockPublicPolicy: true
      Tags:
        - Key: Environment
          Value: staging
        - Key: CostCenter
          Value: CC-1234
        - Key: Owner
          Value: jane.developer@company.com
  
  # ... Lambda and API Gateway configs ...

Security checks: All passed
Governance checks: All passed

Approve deployment? [Yes/No]
```

### Developer Approves

```
Yes, deploy it.
```

### Deployment Complete

```
Deployment successful!

Created resources:
- S3: staging-user-portal-uploads-bucket
- Lambda: staging-user-portal-upload-processor
- API Gateway: staging-user-portal-upload-api

Endpoint: https://abc123.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads
```

**Total time: ~3 minutes**. No tickets. No handoffs. Full compliance.

## Handling Violations

What happens when a developer tries something that violates the rules?

### Example: Attempting a Public Bucket

```
Developer: "Create a public S3 bucket for marketing assets"
```

```
Deployment blocked

Security baseline violation detected:
• Rule: block-public-access
• Resource: S3 bucket
• Issue: Public access is not allowed for this workload

Options:
1. Deploy as private bucket with CloudFront distribution (recommended)
2. Request a security exception through CloudAgent

Would you like me to create a private bucket with CloudFront instead?
```

The developer can either accept the compliant alternative or escalate through proper channels, but they can't accidentally deploy a public bucket.

## Benefits Summary

| Stakeholder | Before | After |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| **Developers** | Days waiting for infra tickets | Minutes via IDE chat |
| **Security** | Manual reviews, missed violations | Automated enforcement, full coverage |
| **Platform** | Chasing teams for tagging compliance | Auto-applied governance |
| **Leadership** | Shadow IT and compliance risk | Full visibility and control |
